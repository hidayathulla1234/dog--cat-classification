# dog--cat-classification
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model learns visual features from images and predicts whether the given image is a cat or a dog.

🚀 Features

Image classification using CNN

Binary classification (Cat / Dog)

Model trained on labeled image dataset

High accuracy with image preprocessing and normalization

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib

OpenCV (optional)

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains two folders:

cats/ – images of cats

dogs/ – images of dogs

Images are resized and normalized before training.

⚙️ Workflow

Load and preprocess image data

Split dataset into training and testing sets

Build CNN model

Train the model

Evaluate performance

Predict new images

📊 Results

The trained model successfully classifies cat and dog images with good accuracy.

Performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.

▶️ How to Run
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib opencv-python
python train.py

📌 Future Enhancements

Improve accuracy using data augmentation

Deploy model using Streamlit or Flask

Add more animal categories
